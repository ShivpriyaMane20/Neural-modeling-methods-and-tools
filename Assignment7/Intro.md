# Multilingual Chatbot and Embedding Training Project

## Overview
This project explores language embeddings in Hindi by training custom embeddings using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Word2Vec, and a shallow Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. The project then builds a chatbot based on these embeddings to assess their effectiveness in understanding and responding to Hindi language inputs. Each embedding type is evaluated and compared for performance and quality.

## Project Structure
- `Assignment7_Snehal_Shivpriya_Group15.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all steps of the assignment, including training language embeddings, building and evaluating the chatbot, and comparing embeddings.

## Objectives
The objectives of this assignment include:
1. **Train Language Embeddings**: Use Word2Vec to train embeddings in Hindi, providing an alternative to typical English-based models.
2. **Develop RNN-based Embeddings**: Train embeddings using an RNN model instead of Word2Vec to demonstrate improved performance and contextual understanding in language representation.
3. **Build a Chatbot**: Develop a chatbot using the trained embeddings and compare its performance with an English-based model, analyzing the effect of multilingual embeddings.
4. **Compare Embedding Quality**: Assess the quality of embeddings generated by Word2Vec, RNN, and pre-trained embeddings. Evaluate them creatively using the chatbot's performance and other metrics.
5. **Train and Compare a DNN Model**: Implement a shallow DNN to generate embeddings and compare its results with the RNN-based embeddings.

## Approach
1. **Embedding Training**:
   - *Word2Vec*: Hindi embeddings are generated using the Word2Vec model for foundational language representation.
   - *RNN-based Embeddings*: An RNN model is used to create embeddings with sequential dependencies, enhancing the model's understanding of language context.
   - *DNN-based Embeddings*: A shallow DNN model is trained to develop embeddings for comparison.

2. **Chatbot Development**:
   - A chatbot is implemented to leverage the custom embeddings, evaluating its response quality and understanding of Hindi phrases.
   - The chatbot's performance is tested against different embeddings, including RNN, Word2Vec, and pre-trained embeddings, to identify the most effective method for natural language understanding.

3. **Embedding Comparison**:
   - Evaluation metrics such as word similarity, analogy tasks, and chatbot response accuracy are used to measure embedding quality.
   - Comparisons highlight the strengths and limitations of each embedding approach, with RNN embeddings showing improved contextual performance.

4. **Results**:
   - The RNN-based chatbot outperforms the baseline Word2Vec model in contextual understanding, while DNN embeddings serve as an efficient alternative with competitive results.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates that RNN-based embeddings are superior in capturing sequential information, which enhances chatbot performance. Word2Vec provides reliable but basic embeddings, while DNN embeddings offer an efficient middle ground. The chatbot's success with RNN embeddings indicates the potential for contextually aware conversational models in Hindi.
