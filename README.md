# Machine Learning and Neural Networks - Projects and Assignments

## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of my coursework and personal projects in **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Neural Networks (NN)**. As part of my studies in **INFO 6106** under **Professor Dino** at **Northeastern University**, I have gained a strong foundation in several key concepts, including:

- **Decision Trees** and the **ID3 algorithm**
- **Information entropy** and **Statistical mechanics entropy**
- **Gini impurity** and **ROC curves**
- **Hyperparameter tuning**

In addition to course assignments, I am continuously working on personal projects in **machine learning** and **neural networks** to deepen my understanding and apply advanced concepts to real-world problems. This repository showcases my progress and growth in these areas.

### Contents
